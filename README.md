# Wheat Harvesters Presents: hearRING

## Description
HearRING is an iOS/Apple Watch application designed to make life easier for deaf members of society. It consists of speech to text printed to the phone's screen, vibration-based alarms set on the phone for use on the Apple Watch, noise level recognition in decibels, environmental sound classification so a deaf person may have context for surrounding noise, and text to speech for communication with others who do not understand sign language.

## App Location
The Swift application can be found on the path src/watch/hearRINGiOSWatchOS.

## Building the App
Requirements: A modern (Mojave or later) MacOS environment with Xcode installed.
To build the project, open the hearRINGiOSWatchOS.xcodeproject file, located in the app's main folder, in Xcode. Following this action, either build the project to a built-in emulator or connect an iPhone (6 or later) paired to an Apple Watch (Series 3 or later) to the computer running Xcode and build to the physical devices.
