# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Page
On this page of the website, users can find many questions that they may find relevant or want answered. This way they do no have to wait on a response from the developers, us, and can continue on with what they are doing sooner. This page may change over time as more questions are added or no longer relevant questions are phased put.

# About Page
From here, users can learn more about HearRing itself and learn more about the developers themselves. The webpage documents some of the more important details of HearRing so as to create necessary redundancy with the FAQ page. There are also brief descriptions of each of the developers and what portions of the project they developed.
