# Sound Detection Page
This page shows a horizontal value bar in which the displayed value is the decibel level detected by the watch's built in microphone. When the bar is green, the watch will not vibrate. When the color changes to yellow, the watch will vibrate weakly. When the color changes to red, the watch will vibrate strongly. The exact values for these thresholds are controlled by the user via the settings page on either the watch or the iPhone. Underneath this is the name of the last alarm modified. If the alarm is on, it will say true underneath the name. Otherwise, it will say false. As a default, there will be the text "NameUnknown" set to false.

# Settings Page
This page features two sliders for the user to adjust the thresholds for the vibration levels. The weak slider adjusts the value at which weak vibrations (indicated by the yellow coloration on the sound detection page) begin. The strong slider adjusts the value at which strong vibrations (indicated by the red coloration on the sound detection page) begin. Both of these sliders can be adjusted by the "-" and "+" buttons on their respective sides or by rotating the Apple Watch's digital crown. The digitial crown allows for much more precise input than the "-" and "+" buttons allow.
